abstract = {We present a human-robot dialogue system that enables a robot to work together with a human user to build wooden construction toys. We then describe a study which assessed the responses of naive users to output that varied along two dimensions: the method of describing an assembly plan (pre-order or post-order), and the method of referring to objects in the world (basic and full). Varying both of these factors produced significant results: sub- jects using the system that employed a pre-order description strategy asked for instructions to be repeated significantly less often than those who experienced the post-order strategy, while the subjects who heard references generated by the full reference strategy judged the robot’s instructions to be significantly more understandable than did those who heard the output of the basic strategy.},

This article takes you through a critical appraisal exercise using a recent article from the British Medical Journal as an example. It describes how you decide whether to read and use an article that may be relevant to your decision. The reading is guided by a series of questions. First you evaluate the validity of the article: is the study conducted and reported so that you may trust the results? The second set of questions discusses the outcomes, the effect of the intervention and describes the use of confidence intervals for this. The possibility of using the research results in the reader's setting and patient population is then evaluated.},

abstract = {The Robotics Technology Branch at the NASA Johnson Space Center is developing robotic systems to assist astronauts in space. One such system, Robonaut, is a humanoid robot with the dexterity approaching that of a suited astronaut. Robonaut currently has two dexterous arms and hands, a three degree-of-freedom articulating waist, and a two degree-of-freedom neck used as a camera and sensor platform. In contrast to other space manipulator systems, Robonaut is designed to work within existing corridors and use the same tools as space walking astronauts. Robonaut is envisioned as working with astronauts, both autonomously and by teleoperation, performing a variety of tasks including, routine maintenance, setting up and breaking down worksites, assisting crew members while outside of spacecraft, and serving in a rapid response capacity.},

abstract = {Lovotics is a novel field of research that strives to achieve a close relationship between humans and robots by utilizing fundamental concepts from psychology, biology, neuroscience, and robotics to develop a model that effectively imitates human affection process to create an emotionally engaging robotic system with high level of intimacy. We have designed and developed a robotics system that is an active participant in a bi-directional non verbal communication process with humans, and uses audio and touch channels along with internal state parameters in order to establish long standing bonds with individuals. The novel Affective Intelligence system of Lovotics includes an Artificial Endocrine System and an Intimacy Module. These two modules work in tandem to develop intimate interactions between the robot and humans.},
