abstract = {We present a human-robot dialogue system that enables a robot to work together with a human user to build wooden construction toys. We then describe a study which assessed the responses of naive users to output that varied along two dimensions: the method of describing an assembly plan (pre-order or post-order), and the method of referring to objects in the world (basic and full). Varying both of these factors produced significant results: sub- jects using the system that employed a pre-order description strategy asked for instructions to be repeated significantly less often than those who experienced the post-order strategy, while the subjects who heard references generated by the full reference strategy judged the robot’s instructions to be significantly more understandable than did those who heard the output of the basic strategy.},

abstract = {The Robotics Technology Branch at the NASA Johnson Space Center is developing robotic systems to assist astronauts in space. One such system, Robonaut, is a humanoid robot with the dexterity approaching that of a suited astronaut. Robonaut currently has two dexterous arms and hands, a three degree-of-freedom articulating waist, and a two degree-of-freedom neck used as a camera and sensor platform. In contrast to other space manipulator systems, Robonaut is designed to work within existing corridors and use the same tools as space walking astronauts. Robonaut is envisioned as working with astronauts, both autonomously and by teleoperation, performing a variety of tasks including, routine maintenance, setting up and breaking down worksites, assisting crew members while outside of spacecraft, and serving in a rapid response capacity.},
